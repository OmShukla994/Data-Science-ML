    "- Regular expressions (called REs, or regexes, or regex patterns) are essentially a tiny, highly specialized programming language embedded inside Python and made available through the **re module**.\n",
    "-  Using this little language, you specify the rules for the set of possible strings that you want to match; this set might contain English sentences, or e-mail addresses, or TeX commands, or anything you like.\n",
    "- Hereâ€™s a complete list of the metacharacters :  ^ $ * + ? { } [ ] \\ | ( )\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first metacharacters weâ€™ll look at are [ and ]. Theyâ€™re used for specifying a character class, which is a set of characters that you wish to match. Characters can be listed individually, or a range of characters can be indicated by giving two characters and separating them by a '-'. For example, [abc] will match any of the characters a, b, or c; this is the same as [a-c], which uses a range to express the same set of characters. If you wanted to match only lowercase letters, your RE would be [a-z].\n",
    "\n",
    "Metacharacters are not active inside classes. For example, [akm$] will match any of the characters 'a', 'k', 'm', or '$'; '$' is usually a metacharacter, but inside a character class itâ€™s stripped of its special nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can match the characters not listed within the class by complementing the set. This is indicated by including a '^' as the first character of the class. For example, [^5] will match any character except '5'. If the caret appears elsewhere in a character class, it does not have special meaning. For example: [5^] will match either a '5' or a '^'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the most important metacharacter is the backslash, \\. As in Python string literals, the backslash can be followed by various characters to signal various special sequences. Itâ€™s also used to escape all the metacharacters so you can still match them in patterns; for example, if you need to match a [ or \\, you can precede them with a backslash to remove their special meaning: \\[ or \\\\.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the special sequences beginning with '\\' represent predefined sets of characters that are often useful, such as the set of digits, the set of letters, or the set of anything that isnâ€™t whitespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matching Characters\n",
    "Most letters and characters will simply match themselves. For example, the regular expression test will match the string test exactly. (You can enable a case-insensitive mode that would let this RE match Test or TEST as well; more about this later.)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are exceptions to this rule; some characters are special metacharacters, and donâ€™t match themselves. Instead, they signal that some out-of-the-ordinary thing should be matched, or they affect other portions of the RE by repeating them or changing their meaning.\n",
