    "Raised when an assert statement fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "- exception AttributeError\n",
    "Raised when an attribute reference (see Attribute references) or assignment fails. (When an object does not support attribute references or attribute assignments at all, TypeError is raised.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- exception EOFError\n",
    "Raised when the input() function hits an end-of-file condition (EOF) without reading any data. (N.B.: the io.IOBase.read() and io.IOBase.readline() methods return an empty string when they hit EOF.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- exception FloatingPointError\n",
    "Not currently used.\n",
    "\n",
    "- exception GeneratorExit\n",
    "Raised when a generator or coroutine is closed; see generator.close() and coroutine.close(). It directly inherits from BaseException instead of Exception since it is technically not an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "- exception ImportError\n",
    "Raised when the import statement has troubles trying to load a module. Also raised when the “from list” in from ... import has a name that cannot be found.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Assertion?\n",
    "Assertions are statements that assert or state a fact confidently in your program. For example, while writing a division function, you're confident the divisor shouldn't be zero, you assert divisor is not equal to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Assertions are simply boolean expressions that checks if the conditions return true or not. If it is true, the program does nothing and move to the next line of code. However, if it's false, the program stops and throws an error\n",
    "- Python's assert statement is a debugging aid that tests a condition. If the condition is true, it does nothing and your program just continues to execute. But if the assert condition evaluates to false, it raises an AssertionError exception with an optional error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python assert Statement\n",
    "Python has built-in assert statement to use assertion condition in the program. assert statement has a condition or expression which is supposed to be always true. If the condition is false assert halts the program and gives an AssertionError."
